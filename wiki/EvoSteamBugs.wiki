#summary Common problems steam people have so that I don't forget.

= Engine "stuck at 100%" =

Apparently pr-downloader gets the 7z archive, starts extracting, creates the 96.0 dir, but no unitsync.dll or spring.exe can be found inside.
In weblobby.log it complains about being unable to load unitsync because "127" which is ERROR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND.

= pr-downloader fails to download =

For some people it fails to download for some reason.
Causes errors lile "Cannot start command: Downloading Map Eye_Of_Horus_v2: in file '..\Boost.Process-0.5/boost/process/windows/initializers/throw_on_error.hpp', line 24: CreateProcess() failed".

= Game download stuck at 0% =

Probably excessive server load.

= Cannot create process: assign: wrong argument =

Windows XP

= Cannot load unitsync: 87 =

Windows with KB2533623 not installed.

= The package file is corrupted =

Sometimes the file corresponding to the game in Spring/packages becomes corrupted on download and pr-download thinks it's already downloaded and doesn't do anything. In weblobby.log you see unitsync loading successfully, pr-downloader getting launched and finishing, and that repeats every time the user joins a battle. Deleting Spring/packages solved that in all cases that I saw.

= Paths with non-ASCII characters =

If the path to My games/Spring contains non-ASCII characters, the lobby fails to work. Sorry, my fuckup.
