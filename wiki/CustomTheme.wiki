= Creating a Custom Theme in Weblobby =

You can create a custom theme with Weblobby to match your website or game. The URL may contain a string which Weblobby loads as the default settings, until the user changes them and it gets saved to the user's cookies. To create the URL:

 * Open http://weblobby.springrts.com/
 * Set up the colors in the settings tab.
 * Open Firebug and select the Cookies tab.
 * Expand the "settings" cookie.
 * Select the "Raw Data" tab and copy the text.
 * Create a URL like so: http://weblobby.springrts.com?settings=<raw data here>
 * Link to this URL or use an iframe.
