#summary Stuff left to fix in Carbon theme.

1) Dropdown styles

- multiplayer map selection

- some singleplayer stuff

- generally make them less bland

2) Button styles

- get rid of gradient highlights, hack up proper chili-esque style

- special color button is special, needs to have button style

- chat-tab left buttons have icons at weird offsets

3) Edges

- some rounded elements have background-colors and no border-radius, ex: topic, chat. Should be transparent and/or border-radius.

- chat entry line has geborked border-image (element size too small for proper rendering)

- minor border-image corruptions on chat tabs

4) Images need to be carbonized:

- checkboxes

- radiobuttons

- etc

5) Sliders need to be carbonized

- webkit allows browser scrollbars to be styled.

- use chili sliders for glory and profit.
