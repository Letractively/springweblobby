#summary Stuff left to fix in Carbon theme.

1) Button styles

- get rid of gradient highlights, hack up proper chili-esque style

- special color button is special, needs to have button style

- chat-tab left buttons have icons at weird offsets

2) Edges

- some rounded elements have background-colors and no border-radius, ex: topic, chat. Should be transparent and/or border-radius.

- chat entry line has geborked border-image (element size too small for proper rendering)

- minor border-image corruptions on chat tabs (even if it looks cool)

3) Images need to be carbonized:

- checkboxes

- radiobuttons

- dropdown buttons

- tab selection buttons (when window made tiny)

- add more

4) Sliders need to be carbonized

- webkit allows browser scrollbars to be styled.

- use chili sliders for glory and profit.

5) Paddings

- chat active tab X-button is too far to right, overlays border-image
