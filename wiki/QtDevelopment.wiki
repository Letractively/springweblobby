= Command line options =

== Custom URL ==

-url URL - forces weblobby to open URL instead of the default one. Very useful for testing with file:// urls and localhost.

Example to run it with a custom URL

{{{
./weblobby -url http://localhost:123
}}}

== Debugging options ==

 * -debug - enable debug output
 * -debug-cmd - include command output in the log (pr-downloader nagging, spring console output)
 * -debug-net - print all data sent to and received from uberserver
 * -debug-all - all of the above

== Prepackaged data ==

-prepackaged-data PATH - The path should be absolute and point to a folder. On lobby start everything inside the folder will be moved to spring home dir. The folder itself won't be removed. If it doesn't exist, an error is shown.

E.g. if you have c:\evo_data that has evo_data/pool, evo_data/packages, evo_data/weblobby/engine, evo_data/maps; you use -prepackaged-data c:\evo_data
